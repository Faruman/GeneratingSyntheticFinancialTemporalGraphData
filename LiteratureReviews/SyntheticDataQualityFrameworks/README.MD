## Synthetic Data Quality Frameworks

To identify theoretically grounded and field-accepted dimensions for assessing synthetic data quality, we conducted a structured literature review. The review was designed to surface existing synthetic data evaluation frameworks and the quality dimensions they operationalize, with the goal of consolidating this fragmented landscape into a unified, reusable framework.

### Literature Search Query

### Selection and Extraction Procedure

After identifying candidate papers, we applied three inclusion criteria:

1. Metric coverage: The paper reports at least two evaluation metrics (to avoid purely illustrative or single-metric discussions).
2. Conceptual structure: The paper defines metric categories and/or proposes an explicit evaluation/quality framework (to enable synthesis at the dimension level).
3. Domain scope: The paper does not primarily focus on text or image data (to retain relevance for structured, time-series, and graph settings).

From the final set, we extracted the quality dimensions (metric categories) proposed in each paper and integrated them into a consolidated framework. the following table summarizes the occurrence of each dimension across the included studies:
