# SCALABLE, INDUCTIVE, FEATURE-RICH – A NEW ALGORITHM FOR GENERATING SYNTHETIC FINANCIAL TEMPORAL GRAPH DATA

## Abstract
Financial crime has scaled with digital banking, but advanced AML models that exploit temporal and graph structure remain constrained by scarce, privacy-sensitive transaction data. Illicit events are rare, patterns drift, and inter-bank sharing is limited by regulation, confidentiality, and competitive concerns. This paper addresses three coupled needs: generating realistic transaction temporal graphs, providing rigorous privacy guarantees, and evaluating synthetic data beyond isolated attribute checks. We contribute (1) SDQF, a synthetic data quality framework organizing metrics across fidelity, generalization, utility, and privacy over datapoint-, sequence-, and graph-level structure; (2) FINNETS, a scalable temporal-graph generator combining community-based decomposition, a temporal structural decoder, and factorized decoders for structure and attributes; and (3) FINNETS-DP, a node-level differentially private training pipeline combining PrivCom with a PATE-style teacher–student mechanism. Experiments on two public AML benchmarks and a proprietary bank dataset show improved structural realism and downstream AML utility with formal privacy accounting.
